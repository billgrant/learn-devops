# learn-devops

I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/14hl4ha/comment/jpcampc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Coming from Network Engineering > Network Automation > Pre-sales Engineering. I realized that while I worked on most of these technologies I have never build application from scratch like is suggested in the post.
